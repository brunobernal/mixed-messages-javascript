## General info
In order to increase my learning process during this project I decided to generate random messages related to javascript.
The program logs different methods (name, syntax, description, example) based on random choices of the object type (array, string, math) and the difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
It helped me a lot to practice what IÂ´ve been learning so far and get to know new methods while building the data structure.

## Technologies
* JavaScript

## Setup
The program runs on the console.
